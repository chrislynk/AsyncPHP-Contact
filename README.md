# AsyncPHP-Contact
Uses Ajax to submit a contact form to PHP backend. Inspired by a post from Matt West on http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/create-ajax-contact-form

A common feature of many websites is a contact form. Standard contact forms work just fine, but you can make them nicer by using AJAX to submit the form data in the background.

The included demo creates a website contact form that submits the form data using AJAX. It uses jQuery to help simplify the JavaScript code and a simple PHP mailer script to handle sending the form data via email.

# The Demo

This simple demo has the following structure
	\assets\css\contactform.css
	\assets\js\ajaxform.js
	\assets\js\jquery.min.js
	\assets\php\mailer.php
	\form.html
